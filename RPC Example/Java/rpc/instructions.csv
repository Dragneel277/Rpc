To implement the Java code I provided, you can follow these steps:

1-Create a new directory and name it rpc.
2-Inside the rpc directory, create a new directory and name it server.
3-Inside the server directory, create a new file and name it Server.java.
4-Copy and paste the server code I provided into the Server.java file.
5-Save the Server.java file.
6-Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the rpc/server directory.
7-Type javac Server.java and press Enter to compile the server.
8-Type java Server and press Enter to start the server. You should see a message indicating that the server is running.
9-Open a new command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the rpc directory.
10-Inside the rpc directory, create a new directory and name it client.
11-Inside the client directory, create a new file and name it Client.java.
12-Copy and paste the client code I provided into the Client.java file.
13-Save the Client.java file.
14-Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the rpc/client directory.
15-Type javac Client.java and press Enter to compile the client.
16-Type java Client and press Enter to run the client. 
    You should see the result of the addNumbers function call (5) printed to the console.

Note that you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer in order to compile 
and run this code. You can download the JDK from the Oracle website. 
Also, make sure that you have set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path of your JDK installation.
